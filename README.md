# ASCII_Image_Converter
This is a Python script meant to convert a standard jpg image into an ASCII art version of it. This project was influenced greatly by Raphson (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw-fjV4OtVbMiehW5s2Yiig).

The program fetches images from the resources folder so be sure to store the images that you want converted in there or the program won't work.
Every time the program is run the output files get overwritten so rename or move the files between each conversion.
